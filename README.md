# Multi-Layer Perceptron

Assignment 4 - CS 663 - Machine Learning

In addition to this README.md file, this repository contains two (2) files:

* `Assignment 4 - MLP.ipynb`: which is a notebook for your to start your implementation of this assignment
* `winequality-red.csv`: which is the data for testing, also available at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality), at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sh6147782/winequalityred), etc.

You may make any changes you like to the notebook. Find assignment details on Canvas.
